# QSelf_Project_Weightlifting_Tracker
The goal of this project is to create an application able to recognize different activities like squat, benchpress,... and give a summary of the activities done during a workout.
Heartbeat monitor and accelerometers will be use to track the activities. We'll try (if the time allow it) to use image recognison. The end goal should be a mobile application.
